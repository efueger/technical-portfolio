## About This Portfolio

This repository contains technical labs and frameworks built while transitioning to new solution engineering roles. The content includes:

**Technical Labs:**
- Production-quality demonstrations of database security, API troubleshooting, and observability
- Real-world scenarios reflecting enterprise customer implementations
- Clear documentation with business context

**Frameworks & Methodologies:**
- Change management and enablement strategies for customer adoption
- Executive communication templates for translating technical decisions to business impact

These materials showcase my ability to:
- Learn new technologies quickly and explain them clearly
- Troubleshoot complex technical issues with a customer-first mindset
- Build production-quality demonstrations that reflect real-world use cases
- Document technical concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences

## Background

I spent 10 years at Code Climate as a Solutions Engineer and Senior Technical Support Engineer, where I:
- Led escalations for Fortune 10/50 enterprise customers
- Built automation and reporting tools using Python, SQL, and modern APIs
- Reduced escalation times by 30-40% using AI-enabled workflows
- Authored 200+ technical guides for APIs, SSO, and security workflows
- Managed Support Ops migrations, automated workflows, mentored team members and peers

I hold AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) and Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) certifications.

## Labs & Demonstrations

### 🗄️ Database & Backend
- **[Supabase RLS Enterprise Demo](./labs/supabase-rls-enterprise-demo/)** - Multi-tenant application with Row Level Security, demonstrating how I'd help customers implement secure data isolation

### 🔭 Observability & Monitoring
- *Coming soon: Docker + OpenTelemetry observability stack*

### 🔌 API Integration
- *Coming soon: REST API troubleshooting guide with common patterns*

## Projects

### Meal Planning POC
A simple web app to display weekly meal plans without Google Drive login.
- **Tech Stack**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, JSON, GitHub Pages
- **Live Demo**: https://efueger.github.io/meal-planning-poc/
- **Code**: https://github.com/efueger/meal-planning-poc

## Frameworks & Methodologies

Beyond technical skills, I focus on change enablement and executive communication:
- **[Change Enablement for Solutions Engineers](./frameworks/change-enablement.md)** - How to help customers adopt new tools successfully
- **[Executive Communication Templates](./frameworks/executive-communication.md)** - Translating technical decisions into business impact

## Technologies I Work With

**Strong:** Python, SQL, REST APIs, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Bitbucket), Observability (Datadog, OpenTelemetry), SSO/SAML, Change Management

**Additional Focus On:** Supabase/Postgres, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, React/Next.js, Ruby
