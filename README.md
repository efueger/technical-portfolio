## For Hiring Managers

**Looking for specific examples?**

- **Workflow Automation**: [Tines workflows](./labs/workflow-automation/tines/) with HMAC auth and API integration
- **Container Troubleshooting**: [Kubernetes debugging](./labs/kubernetes/) with systematic diagnostic workflows
- **API Integration**: [n8n automation](./labs/workflow-automation/n8n/) with parallel execution patterns
- **Database Security**: [Postgres Row-Level Security](./labs/database/postgres-row-level-security/) implementation

**Background**: 10 years at Code Climate leading Fortune 10/50 escalations, reducing resolution times 30-40%

## Demonstrations

### Workflow Automation & API Integration

#### Tines

**[View all Tines projects →](./labs/workflow-automation/tines/)**

**Certifications:** Tines University Core Certification (2025) | Tines University Advanced Certification (2025)

Hands-on workflow automation demonstrating security operations patterns, cryptographic authentication, and API orchestration using Tines' formula-based platform.

**Key demonstrations:**

- **[HMAC-SHA256 Authentication](./labs/workflow-automation/tines/HMAC%20Authentication.md)** - Cryptographic request signing implementation (AWS/Shopify/Stripe patterns)
- **[GitHub Issue Monitor](./labs/workflow-automation/tines/github-issue-monitor/)** - Webhook-driven automation with error handling and Slack integration
- **[Pagination & Formulas](./labs/workflow-automation/tines/pagination-formulas/)** - Advanced Liquid template patterns and array processing

---

#### n8n

**[View all n8n projects →](./labs/workflow-automation/n8n/)**

Open-source workflow automation with JavaScript-based transformations demonstrating API monitoring, GitHub automation, and parallel execution patterns.

**Key demonstrations:**

- **[API Health Monitor](./labs/workflow-automation/n8n/api-monitor/)** - Multi-endpoint monitoring with parallel execution
- **[GitHub Issue Bot](./labs/workflow-automation/n8n/github-issue-bot/)** - Automated categorization and routing
- **[API Monitor with Notifications](./labs/workflow-automation/n8n/api-monitor-with-notifications/)** - Comprehensive monitoring with alerting

---

### Infrastructure & Troubleshooting

#### Kubernetes

**[View Kubernetes labs →](./labs/kubernetes/)**

Systematic troubleshooting workflows for containerized applications, demonstrating diagnostic patterns for technical support and solutions engineering roles.

**What I built:**

- Deploy and scale workflows (self-healing demonstration)
- Debug ImagePullBackOff errors (systematic troubleshooting approach)
- Kubernetes API integration (HTTP-based automation patterns)
- Port-forwarding for debugging (temporary access workflows)

**Real-world application:** Customer reports container failures → Systematic diagnosis workflow → Root cause identification → Resolution with clear documentation

---

### Database & Backend

#### Postgres Row-Level Security

**[View database security labs →](./labs/database/postgres-row-level-security/)**

Multi-tenant application security patterns demonstrating how to implement enterprise-grade data isolation at the database level.

## Background

I spent 10 years at Code Climate as a Solutions Engineer and Senior Technical Support Engineer, where I:

- Led escalations for Fortune 10/50 enterprise customers
- Built automation and reporting tools using Python, SQL, and modern APIs
- Reduced escalation times by 30-40% using AI-enabled workflows
- Authored 200+ technical guides for APIs, SSO, and security workflows
- Managed Support Ops migrations, automated workflows, mentored team members and peers

I hold AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) and Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) certifications.

## About This Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on technical demonstrations built while transitioning to solutions engineering and technical support roles. Each lab includes:

- **Production-quality implementations** - Real workflows and integrations, not "Hello World" demos
- **Business context** - Clear explanations of how technical patterns map to customer problems
- **Systematic documentation** - Troubleshooting workflows, key learnings, and real-world applications

These materials demonstrate my ability to:

- Learn new technologies quickly and explain them clearly
- Troubleshoot complex technical issues with a customer-first mindset
- Build production-quality demonstrations that reflect enterprise use cases
- Document technical concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences
